- 👋 Hi, I’m @AllOfMeUc3
- 👀 I’m interested in a technology, botany, astronomy, art, the monomyth, math, life, philosophy, but most importantly of all people who want to have a good conversation!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning all of the above, with a heavy focus on robotics engineering and math. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that helps me get a better intuition for algorithmic thinking, I'm very new to this and am still trying to understand basics.
